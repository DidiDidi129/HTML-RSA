# HTML-RSA
Encryption and Decryption tool that I used in school

# To use:
You need a RSA Keypair. Both files should be in .key format.
Upload to the main html file and encrypt your message.
Only the correct private key can be used to decrypt the message

# To generate a new Keypair:
Open the Random200Digits file and click download.
Open the generate keypair file and upload your random digits.
Copy the Public Key and save it in a empty txt file.
Change the file extention to .key
Do the same but for private key.
